### A Cunning Plan

I just worked out that I can install restic in the kopia docker package which should at least help simplify things during testing.

```bash 
apk add restic 
``` 
so now have one minimal package with both applications using the same rclone config.

What could possibly go wrong?

## Backup Software

### Kopia

```bash
root@kopia:/# kopia --version
20240713.0.0- build:  from:
```

[Actions](https://kopia.io/docs/advanced/actions/)

### Restic

```bash
root@kopia:/# restic version
restic 0.16.5 compiled with go1.22.5 on linux/amd64
```

I've been playing with a wrapper for restic called [resticprofile](https://creativeprojects.github.io/resticprofile/). It lets you easily write a yaml script for restic, and includes scheduling and notifications via command hooks and http hooks.

```bash
resticprofile version
resticprofile version 0.27.1 commit eb130039b794e944223c7192673ccb04814347ca
```

My basic yaml is below (anything inside <> has been changed to protect my information).

```yaml
version: "1"

default:
  repository: "rclone:backblaze:<repository>"
  password-file: "password.txt"

  backup:
    verbose: true
    source:
      - "/home/me"
      - "/var/www/"

    schedule: "22:00"

    send-before:
      - method: POST
        url: <link to uptime kuma>

    run-before: '<link to apprise>'

    run-after: '<link to apprise>'

    run-after-fail: '<link to apprise>'
```
