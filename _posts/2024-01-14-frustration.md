Just spent a frustrating hour or two trying to get a nicer back end installed on here, but with no luck. DecapCMS kept on trying to authorize itself with Netlify, despite authorizing myself to do it. 

So instead I am using Typora to create this post. It's a very nice, simple to use but comprehensive Markdown editor. Main reason I was looking for something else is that it would be nice to have something available anywhere.

It does also need access to the filesystem (in this case via a SMB share), which is another negative.

Maybe that's where I'm going wrong. I want all the advantages of a Wordpress, without all the disadvantages.

Maybe I should look at something that works directly in the git repository, or the  git editor.

You can however drag images straight into the md file when editing it in Visual Studio Code.
