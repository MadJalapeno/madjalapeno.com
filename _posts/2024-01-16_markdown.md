Just found that **SHIFT-CTRL-V** brings up a preview window for markdown, which is great as I've been trying all sorts of programs to make writing easier.

I still think that [Typora](https://typora.io/) is the best app for markdown, as long as you have file access, otherwise you're copy pasting into the window.
