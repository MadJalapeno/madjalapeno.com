#### Pagination. it does work

Found a [good guide](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/pagination/nav/) on the 11ty docs website. Also [this repository](https://github.com/lwojcik/eleventy-template-bliss/tree/main) on github has some useful snippits.

But the order is odd. Have the very first and the latest post both showing up on page 1.

Also want to try and find out how to send the whole post to a subroutine (is that what they're called in Nunjucks) to format it nicely. Also some nicer way of formatting links so they show up.
