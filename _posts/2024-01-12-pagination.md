So you can sort multiple posts made on the same day by including the time of the post.


Now in the YAML section at the top of this MarkDown file I have

```yaml
date: 2024-01-12 11:56:00
```

and then it sorts.

Bonus. Now have the page going to a subroutine, so can format it easily too.

(screeching brakes) - odd. There is some content not showing in the right order.
