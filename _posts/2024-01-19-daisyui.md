I had used [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) on a previous site, but decided to go with pure Tailwind here.

I've now realized just how much simpler DaisyUI can make everything, and am bringing it back. It's a more cohesive design than I could acheive by myself, and makes the code simpler, as instead of five or six css classes for most things it has nice defaults built in.

Biggest issue is undoing the over-rides.

Also means simple themes, so light mode and dark mode with the selector.
