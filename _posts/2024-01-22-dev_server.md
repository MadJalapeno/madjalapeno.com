Just posted to Discord:

I'm working on my personal site, and am using 11ty with Tailwind and DaisyUI, and have a frustrating problem.

Most pages and posts call on `default.njk`, which is my main layout.

I'm trying a lot of small variations in the styling at the moment due to how Tailwind works, but the changes to `default.njk` are not coming through to /_site.

The dev server is seeing the file change, and thinks it has overwritten the file.

```
[11ty] [11ty] File changed: src/_layouts/default.njk 
...
[11ty] [11ty] Writing _site/index.html from ./src/index.njk
...
[11ty] [11ty] Benchmark    242ms  73%   676Ã— (Configuration) "slugify" Nunjucks Filter
[11ty] [11ty] Copied 2 files / Wrote 44 files in 0.33 seconds (7.5ms each, v2.0.1)

```

but nothing changes in the html. I've checked the generated html via nano, so know it's not caching in FireFox. If I delete the /_site folder and restart 11ty it all works fine. 

I've checked all the permissions, and everything looks OK.

11ty version is 2.0.1, running on my debian 12 server.
```

package.json contains:

  Even just running `npm run dev:11ty` isn't changing when I change comments in the `default.njk`.
